# Inside debt

Author: Wei Ying Soh

## Abstract
Theory posits that providing CEOs with debt-like compensation such as defined benefit pensions and deferred compensation aligns managerial interests with the interests of debtholders and reduces agency costs of debt. 
Prior theoretical predictions also suggest that short-maturity debt is able to reduce agency costs of debt. 
I investigate whether inside debt compensation and short-maturity debt are substitute mechanisms to mitigate agency costs of debt. After controlling for previously known determinants of debt maturity, I find an inverse relation between CEO inside debt compensation and the use of short-maturity debt. 
This inverse relation is stronger when the payoff of insidedebt compensation to CEOs more closely resembles the payoff of risky debt to external creditors.
